# Web3Playground

An experimental project made to learn and familiarize myself with anything that web3 has to offer. Mainly constructed using ts/react/ethers/mantine/ipfs/sol.

## Notes

- As its an experimental project all functionality is only supposed to work on test networks or in a local testing environment.
- Fetching from the ipfs may sometimes be slow and sometimes results in failed requests, may ruin the UX.

## local dev usage

requires node and npm

1. `npm install` in the root directory
2. `npm run start` in the root directory
